For the Amavie section, you'll need to add real images to the following paths:

1. `/images/amavie/gallery-1.jpg` through `/images/amavie/gallery-5.jpg` - Gallery images showing elegant matchmaking events, candid moments, and venue settings

These should be high-quality photography with a sophisticated aesthetic focusing on:
- Elegant dinner settings
- Candid moments of connection
- Beautiful venue spaces
- The reveal moment when matches discover each other
- Authentic interactions between attendees

The visual style should be minimalist and editorial, using primarily black and white with selective deep red accents where appropriate.
